# odin-recipes
In this project, I demonstrated an understanding of the HTML coding language through the use of git and github which allowed me to save my code every time I added a meaningful change. 

I was scared to do this at first because of using the linux terminal + git but I'm proud of how far I came along. 

I literally did this assignment already but I decided to do it again in hopes of practicing the terminal and git, and also because I'm doing it on a virtual machine that runs Linux instead of Windows as an OS. I will keep going with the Odin Project cuz it is too fun.
